# Capstone_Chiara_Moruzzi
## a capstone project about the legal minimum wage in Italy: analysis of Italian Parliament's Members' tweets.

The aim of my small research is to test the following hypothesis: "Younger members of the Italian 'Camera dei Deputati' are more interested about minimum wage compared to older politicians". 


## Structure
My project's main structure is as follows:
- Scripts: contains my R scripts (divided by topic)
- Output: contains the final report in RMarkdown and HTML
- Plots: contains the jpeg file of the plots I created for the research
- Data: contains the main datasets I used for my analysis
